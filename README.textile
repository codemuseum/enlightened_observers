h1. EnlightenedObservers

This plugin makes it quick and easy to share the controller information with observers, including session information.  This is useful when observers need to report the current_user that made a certain action happen.

The code and idea for this plugin comes from:
"Garry Dolley's Let ActiveRecord Observers see controller context":http://scie.nti.st/2007/2/1/let-activerecord-observers-see-controller-context


h2. Usage

<pre>
class MyController < ActionController::Base
  include EnlightenedObservers

  observer :my_observer
end
</pre>

Now my_observer has access to a controller instance variable, which can be used to access the session.
e.g. 


h2. Installation 

To enable the library your Rails 2.1 (or greater) project, use the gem configuration method in "<code>config/environment.rb</code>"

<pre>
Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
  config.gem 'moorage-enlightened_observers', :source => 'http://gems.github.com'
end
</pre>

To unpack it into your application, just run:

<pre>
  rake gems:unpack GEM=moorage-enlightened_observers
</pre>
